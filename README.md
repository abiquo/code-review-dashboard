Code review dashboard
=====================

A dashboard to see the status of all opened pull requests.

Before using it, you will need to create a [Github Api Token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens)
and configure it in the `ABQ_REVIEW_TOKEN` environment variable.

Once you have the token configured you can run the dashboard as follows:

    python application.py
